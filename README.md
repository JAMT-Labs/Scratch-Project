Use node fetch in backend with routes to fetch the data from API.

make request to localhost3000/api, when we get that route, make a fetch from server to API (node or axios fetch) within router, add items

server will make a requet to API server. If i want data about events / emergencies

make a request using https://docs.predicthq.com/api/requests
make requst based on information we are trying to get from api, pack data up into an object
then pass that object into our client as a response. then from the response, we get the data, and can get fetch request from component did mount // useeffect, and get data and send it to each component that needs that data
